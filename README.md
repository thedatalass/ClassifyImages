From "The Handbook of Visual Analysis" by Theo Van Leeuwen, Carey Jewitt
"Content analysis, by itself, does not demonstrate how viewers understand or value what they see or hear.
Still, content analysis shows what is given priority or salience and what is not."

"Validity refers to the concept of how well a system of analysis actually measures what it purports to measure."
